# Home Assistant Add-on: TSUN Proxy (Debug)

This is a bleeding-edge version of the `TSUN Proxy`  Add-On with debuging enabled by default.

The versions may be based on different feature branches and therefore the range of functions may change.

It is intended to be used to simulate special situations/problems and should only be used in consultation with the maintainer.

For production please use the stable version `TSUN Proxy`. If you are interested in a bleeding edge version, we offer the `TSUN Proxy (dev)` version.
