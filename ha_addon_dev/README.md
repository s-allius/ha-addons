# Home Assistant Add-on: TSUN Proxy

TSUN Proxy enables a reliable connection between TSUN third generation
inverters and an MQTT broker. With the proxy, you can easily retrieve real-time values
such as power, current and daily energy and integrate the inverter into Home Assistant.
This works even without an internet connection.
The optional connection to the TSUN Cloud can be disabled!
