# Home Assistant Add-on: TSUN Proxy

[TSUN Proxy][tsunproxy] enables a reliable connection between TSUN third generation
inverters and an MQTT broker. With the proxy, you can easily retrieve real-time values
such as power, current and daily energy and integrate the inverter into Home Assistant.
This works even without an internet connection.
The optional connection to the TSUN Cloud can be disabled!

## Pre-requisites

1. This Add-on requires an MQTT broker to work.
For a typical installation, we recommend the [Mosquitto add-on][Mosquitto] running on your Home Assistant.

2. You need to loop the proxy into the connection between the inverter and the TSUN Cloud,
you must adapt the DNS record within the network that your inverter uses. You need a mapping
from logger.talent-monitoring.com and/or iot.talent-monitoring.com to the IP address of your
Home Assistant.
This can be done, for example, by adding a local DNS record to [AdGuard Home Add-on][AdGuard]
(navigate to `filters` on the AdGuard panel and add an entry under `custom filtering rules`).

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Add the repository URL to the Home Assistant add-on store
[![Add repository on my Home Assistant][repository-badge]][repository-url]
2. Reload the add-on store page
3. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
4. Add your inverter configuration to the add-on configuration
5. Start the "TSUN-Proxy" add-on
6. Check the logs of the "TSUN-Proxy" add-on to see if everything went well.

_Please note, the add-on is pre-configured to connect with
Home Assistants default MQTT Broker. There is no need to configure any MQTT parameters
if you're running an MOSQUITTO add-on. Home Assistant communication and TSUN Cloud URL
and Ports are also pre-configured._

This automatic handling of the TSUN Cloud and MQTT Broker conflicts with the
[TSUN Proxy official documentation][tsunproxy]. The official documentation
will state `mqtt.host`, `mqtt.port`, `mqtt.user`, `mqtt.passwd` `solarman.host`,
`solarman.port` `tsun.host`, `tsun.port` and Home Assistant options are required.
For the add-on, however, this isn't needed.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration after installation:

```yaml
inverters:
  - serial: R17E760702080400
    node_id: PV-Garage
    suggested_area: Garage
    modbus_polling: false
    pv1.manufacturer: Shinefar
    pv1.type: SF-M18/144550
    pv2.manufacturer: Shinefar
    pv2.type: SF-M18/144550
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, you need to replace the values with your own!_

Example add-on configuration for GEN3PLUS inverters:

```yaml
inverters:
  - serial: Y17000000000000
    monitor_sn: '2000000000'
    node_id: PV-Garage
    suggested_area: Garage
    modbus_polling: true
    pv1.manufacturer: Shinefar
    pv1.type: SF-M18/144550
    pv2.manufacturer: Shinefar
    pv2.type: SF-M18/144550
    pv3.manufacturer: Shinefar
    pv3.type: SF-M18/144550
    pv4.manufacturer: Shinefar
    pv4.type: SF-M18/144550
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, you need to replace the values with your own!_

## MQQT settings

By default, this add-on requires no `mqtt` config from the user. **This is not an error!**

However, you are free to set them if you want to override, however, in
general usage, that should not be needed and is not recommended for this add-on.
