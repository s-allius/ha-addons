    name: Inverters
    description: >+
      For each GEN3 inverter, the serial number of the inverter must be mapped to an MQTT
      definition. To do this, the corresponding configuration block is started with
      <16-digit serial number> so that all subsequent parameters are assigned
      to this inverter. Further inverter-specific parameters (e.g. polling mode) can be set
      in the configuration block

      The serial numbers of all GEN3 inverters start with `R17`!

      switch on/off connection to the TSUN cloud
      This connection is only required if you want send data to the TSUN cloud
      eg. to use the TSUN APPs or receive firmware updates.
      
      on - normal proxy operation
      off - The Inverter become isolated from Internet

  inverters.allow_all:
    name: Allow all connections from all inverters
    description: >-
      The proxy only usually accepts connections from known inverters.
      Switch on for test purposes and unknown serial numbers.
